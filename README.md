## How to run the programme/use the code

### Using a Terminal:

#### Using Python virtual environment:

1. Download the code or clone the repository using the command `$git clone
   git@github.com:Lexi-BU/lxi_gui.git`

2. Create a virtual environment using the command `$python3 -m venv
   lexi_gui_env` (or any other name you want to give to the environment)
    (for Ubuntu)

    a. Might need to install the python3 venv package using the command
       `$sudo apt-get install python3-venv` (for Ubuntu)
3. Activate the virtual environment using the command `$source
   lexi_gui_env/bin/activate`

4. Install the required packages using the command `$pip install -r
   requirements.txt`

5. Run the file `lxi_gui.py` using the command `$python lxi_gui.py` (or
   `$python3 lxi_gui.py` if you have both python2 and python3 installed).

6. Can also run the file by simply using the command `$./lxi_gui.sh` (if
   the file is an executable file).

#### Using Poetry:

1. Download the code or clone the repository using the command `$git clone
   git@github.com:Lexi-BU/lxi_gui.git`

2. cd into the folder using the command `$cd lxi_gui`

3. Install poetry using the command `$pip install poetry`

4. Install the required packages using the command `$poetry install`

5. Start the virtual environment using the command `$poetry shell`

6. Run the file `lxi_gui.py` using the command `$python lxi_gui.py` (or
   `$python3 lxi_gui.py` if you have both python2 and python3 installed).

7. Can also run the file by simply using the command `$./lxi_gui.sh` (if
    the file is an executable file).

### For Windows:
1. If you are on Windows, you can download the executable file for LUIGI by clicking on this link: [LUIGI Windows](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LIOiDWf1iVsBD70_NCvknc1s4m35v0A-?usp=sharing)

### For Windows/Unix/Mac Os Systems:
1. Download the code.
2. Open a terminal in the folder and type `$./lxi_gui.sh`. If for some reason this doesn't work, check if the file `lxi_gui.sh` is an executable file or not.
    * if it is not, then run the command`$chmod a+x lxi_gui.sh` to make it executable    
4. If you are not using terminal, then use any python (version 3.6 or above, which has pandas and seaborn packages installed) to run the file `lxi_gui.py` and the GUI will pop-up.

Please let me know if you have any trouble in using the program.
